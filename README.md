# allthevibes
Stupid vibe coding project that I want to be shamed about.

Basically following two concepts:

- Provide proper content for functionality
- Provide proper behavior for use by a consumer
The idea and fun of this is that I just wanted to try if I could do this and after doing the first one, I got excited to do more.

I want to try a few different hosted AI options, build either a desktop/mobile/binary application to test who does it better and let my friends shame the shit out of the code to see what can get done better but also have fun with testing functionality.

- Each vibe app will have a ReadME inside its root folder describing what it does and what it was based on.
- Each vibe app will be separated by the AI platform it was made on and the version

All apps created for fun and with no intent for profit.
